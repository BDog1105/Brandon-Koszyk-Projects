Most of my computer experience has come in the last 3 years of my life. Previous to that, I had used computers just as sources of entertainment, but going into college I wanted to know how they worked, so I came to SUNY New Paltz for Computer Engineering. So far in my major, I’ve taken Computer Science 1 – 3, C/C++ Programming, Software Engineering, Digital Logic, Digital System Designs, Microcontroller System Design, Embedded Systems, Intro to Computer Architecture, and VLSI Design. Some notable projects I’ve worked on was a 3D puzzle game on Unreal engine titled Lunar Escape on Unreal Engine 4, where I used the blueprint coding to create a couple of puzzles, a 2-function Lazer/ blaster with first person and third person animations, and other miscellaneous map designing. I’ve used C to code 2 projects with an STMNucleo microcontroller, one project was creating a traffic control system, and the other project was a cruise control system. In Digital Logic and Digital System Designs, I used Verilog coding to code an FPGA board. In Digital Logic I created a 4-bit adder/subtractor, and in Digital System Design I created a keyboard on the FPGA. In Computer Architecture I designed a 32-bit processor with forwarding and exception handling capabilities. 

This class was one that was recommended to me by someone in the Computer Science program, who informed me that the class could provide me with applicable in-demand web development skills. I’ve dabbled with some web development in my free time and was looking for a class to further my skills in it. By the end of this class, I hope to have a good understanding of all the technologies we use, as well as creating projects that I would be satisfied with and be able to display to future employers. As a Computer Engineer, I could choose to go for a more hardware focused or software focused job, so in case I’m looking for a software job I would love to have some web development skills on my toolbelt.
